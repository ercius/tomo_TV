# tomo_TV

C++ toolbox for Total Varation tomographic reconstruction. Specifically, this repository is designed to study the performance of these algorithms as data is 'dynamically' collected to facilitate real-time analysis of tomograms. 

# Features

2D and 3D reconstruction algorithms implemented purely in C++ wrapped in Python functions.  These scripts can either perform simulations (sim) or reconstruct experimental (exp) projections. 

# Installation

For GPU accelerated reconstruction algorithms, we recomend using a Linux operating system. C++ accelerated operations is available on all three operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux). 

[Instructructions for building](BUILDING.md) can be found in the BUILDING.MD document.
